        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Maritza Saldana, and I am a college student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a passionate and determined student. I have excellent interpersonal skills with the ability to engage and work with different teams. I am devoted to building long-lasting relationships with my coworkers and am great at problem-solving by coming up with creative new ideas. I have worked as a cashier, activities leader, and guitarist. In the following, I will explain what I have done in each of these jobs and what experience I gained.
<br><br>

        As a guitarist, I was able to bring joy to many families and amusement and entertainment as they celebrated their special day. Whether it was their birthday, quinceanera, or wedding, we performed weekly at many church festivals. All while I was engaging and communicating with the rest of my band members and clients to ensure a great performance. I was in charge of making sure the clients were satisfied with what they paid for and if they enjoyed the music overall. Throughout my time as a guitarist, I gained a lot of experience in learning how to work with people professionally.
As a cashier and stocker, I had several responsibilities to ensure that all customers were satisfied with their purchases. Every time a customer made a purchase, I would make sure to be patient and help them in any way I could, whether it was helping them bag their groceries or asking if they found everything they needed. I was also responsible for keeping the store clean and organized, and I took extra care to ensure that the shelves were stocked with up-to-date products and that all items were correctly priced. During night shifts, I would clean the belts of the registers and sweep the floors, ensuring that the day shift would have a clean workstation. My priority was to provide excellent customer service and ensure that customers had a positive shopping experience. <br><br>

        Finally, as an activities leader, I was responsible for planning and organizing recreational activities for different age groups. I designed programs that included a range of activities, such as physical exercise, creative arts, and other interactive experiences to promote positive social connections and boost mental health. I ensured that the equipment and facilities were well-maintained and that all participants followed safety guidelines. Being an activities leader allowed me to be creative, organized, and inclusive while adapting to the needs of different groups of people. I also engaged with guardians if there was any problem I felt they needed to know about.
As a guitarist, I have honed my skills in musical theory, technique, and performance. As a cashier, I have learned the importance of attention to detail, efficiency, and customer service. As an activities leader, I have developed skills in communication, planning, and organization. These experiences have provided me with a unique set of skills that I believe will be valuable in any future job. I am eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge to become an exceptional worker in my field.
